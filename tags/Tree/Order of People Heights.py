# You are given the following :

# A positive number N
# Heights : A list of heights of N persons standing in a queue
# Infronts : A list of numbers corresponding to each person (P) that gives the number of persons who are taller than P and standing in front of P
# You need to return list of actual order of personsâ€™s height

# Consider that heights will be unique

# Example

# Input : 
# Heights: 5 3 2 6 1 4
# InFronts: 0 1 2 0 3 2
# Output : 
# actual order is: 5 3 2 1 6 4 
# So, you can see that for the person with height 5, there is no one taller than him who is in front of him, and hence Infronts has 0 for him.

# For person with height 3, there is 1 person ( Height : 5 ) in front of him who is taller than him.

# You can do similar inference for other people in the list.
