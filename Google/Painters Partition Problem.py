# You have to paint N boards of length {A0, A1, A2, A3 â€¦ AN-1}. There are K painters available and you are also given how much time a painter takes to paint 1 unit of board. You have to get this job done as soon as possible under the constraints that any painter will only paint contiguous sections of board.

# 2 painters cannot share a board to paint. That is to say, a board
# cannot be painted partially by one painter, and partially by another.
# A painter will only paint contiguous boards. Which means a
# configuration where painter 1 paints board 1 and 3 but not 2 is
# invalid.
# Return the ans % 10000003

# Input :
# K : Number of painters
# T : Time taken by painter to paint 1 unit of board
# L : A List which will represent length of each board

# Output:
#      return minimum time to paint all boards % 10000003
# Example

# Input : 
#   K : 2
#   T : 5
#   L : [1, 10]
# Output : 50
