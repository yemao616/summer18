# Given n pairs of parentheses, write a function to generate all combinations of well-formed parentheses.

# For example, given n = 3, a solution set is:

# [
#   "((()))",
#   "(()())",
#   "(())()",
#   "()(())",
#   "()()()"
# ]


# If you have two stacks, one for n “(”, the other for n “)”, you generate a binary tree from these two stacks of left/right parentheses to form an output string.

# This means that whenever you traverse deeper, you pop one parentheses from one of stacks. When two stacks are empty, you form an output string.

# How to form a legal string? Here is the simple observation:

# For the output string to be right, stack of “)” most be larger than stack of “(”. If not, it creates string like “())”
# Since elements in each of stack are the same, we can simply express them with a number. For example, left = 3 is like a stacks ["(", “(”, “(”]
