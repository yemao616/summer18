# Given a binary tree, you need to find the length of Longest Consecutive Path in Binary Tree.

# Especially, this path can be either increasing or decreasing. For example, [1,2,3,4] and [4,3,2,1] are both considered valid, but the path [1,2,4,3] is not valid. On the other hand, the path can be in the child-Parent-child order, where not necessarily be parent-child order.

# Example 1:
# Input:
#         1
#        / \
#       2   3
# Output: 2
# Explanation: The longest consecutive path is [1, 2] or [2, 1].
# Example 2:
# Input:
#         2
#        / \
#       1   3
# Output: 3
# Explanation: The longest consecutive path is [1, 2, 3] or [3, 2, 1].
# Note: All the values of tree nodes are in the range of [-1e7, 1e7].
