# Given an integer array with all positive numbers and no duplicates, find the number of possible combinations that add up to a positive integer target.

# Example:

# nums = [1, 2, 3]
# target = 4

# The possible combination ways are:
# (1, 1, 1, 1)
# (1, 1, 2)
# (1, 2, 1)
# (1, 3)
# (2, 1, 1)
# (2, 2)
# (3, 1)

# Note that different sequences are counted as different combinations.

# Therefore the output is 7.
# Follow up:
# What if negative numbers are allowed in the given array?
# How does it change the problem?
# What limitation we need to add to the question to allow negative numbers?


class Solution(object):
    def combinationSum4(self, nums, target):
        """
        :type nums: List[int]
        :type target: int
        :rtype: int
        """
        nums, combs = sorted(nums), [1] + [0] * (target)
        for i in range(target + 1):
            for num in nums:

                combs[i] += combs[i - num]
        return combs[target]



# The problem with negative numbers is that now the combinations could be potentially of infinite length. Think about nums = [-1, 1] and target = 1. We can have all sequences of arbitrary length that follow the patterns -1, 1, -1, 1, ..., -1, 1, 1 and 1, -1, 1, -1, ..., 1, -1, 1 (there are also others, of course, just to give an example). So we should limit the length of the combination sequence, so as to give a bound to the problem.

# This is a recursive Python code that solves the above follow-up problem, so far itâ€™s passed all my test cases but comments are welcome.
